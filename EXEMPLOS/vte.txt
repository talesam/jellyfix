Gets features VTE was compiled with.

since: 0.62

get_features	
Gets a list of features vte was compiled with.

since: 0.40

get_major_version	
Returns the major version of the VTE library at runtime. Contrast this with VTE_MAJOR_VERSION which represents the version of the VTE library that the code was compiled with.

since: 0.40

get_micro_version	
Returns the micro version of the VTE library at runtime. Contrast this with VTE_MICRO_VERSION which represents the version of the VTE library that the code was compiled with.

since: 0.40

get_minor_version	
Returns the minor version of the VTE library at runtime. Contrast this with VTE_MINOR_VERSION which represents the version of the VTE library that the code was compiled with.

since: 0.40

get_termprops	
Gets the names of the installed termprops in an unspecified order.

since: 0.78

get_test_flags	
Gets the test flags; see vte_set_test_flags() for more information. Note that on non-debug builds, this always returns 0.

since: 0.78

get_user_shell	
Gets the user’s shell, or NULL. In the latter case, the system default (usually “/bin/sh”) should be used.

install_termprop	
Installs a new terminal property that can be set by the application.

since: 0.78

install_termprop_alias	
Installs a new terminal property name as an alias for the terminal property target_name.

since: 0.78

query_termprop	
Gets the property type of the termprop. For properties installed by vte_install_termprop(), the name starts with “vte.ext.”.

since: 0.78

query_termprop_by_id	
Like vte_query_termprop() except that it takes the termprop by ID. See that function for more information.

since: 0.78

set_test_flags	
Sets test flags. This function is only useful for implementing unit tests for vte itself; it is a no-op in non-debug builds.

since: 0.54

Function Macros
CHECK_VERSION	
Macro to check the library version at compile time. It returns 1 if the version of VTE is greater or equal to the required one, and 0 otherwise.

[−]
Constants
MAJOR_VERSION	
The major version number of the VTE library (e.g. in version 3.1.4 this is 3).

MICRO_VERSION	
The micro version number of the VTE library (e.g. in version 3.1.4 this is 4).

MINOR_VERSION	
The minor version number of the VTE library (e.g. in version 3.1.4 this is 1).

REGEX_FLAGS_DEFAULT	
SPAWN_NO_PARENT_ENVV	
Use this as a spawn flag (together with flags from GSpawnFlags) in vte_pty_spawn_async().

SPAWN_NO_SYSTEMD_SCOPE	
Use this as a spawn flag (together with flags from GSpawnFlags) in vte_pty_spawn_async().

SPAWN_REQUIRE_SYSTEMD_SCOPE	
Use this as a spawn flag (together with flags from GSpawnFlags) in vte_pty_spawn_async().

TERMPROP_CONTAINER_NAME	
A VTE_PROPERTY_STRING termprop that stores the name of the container.

TERMPROP_CONTAINER_RUNTIME	
A VTE_PROPERTY_STRING termprop that stores the runtime of the container.

TERMPROP_CONTAINER_UID	
A VTE_PROPERTY_UINT termprop that stores the user ID of the container.

TERMPROP_CURRENT_DIRECTORY_URI	
A VTE_PROPERTY_URI termprop that stores the current directory URI as set by OSC 7. Use this with vte_terminal_ref_termprop_uri() instead of using vte_terminal_get_current_directory_uri().

TERMPROP_CURRENT_FILE_URI	
A VTE_PROPERTY_URI termprop that stores the current file URI as set by OSC 6. Use this with vte_terminal_ref_termprop_uri() instead of using vte_terminal_get_current_file_uri().

TERMPROP_NAME_PREFIX	
The string prefix that any termprop’s name must start with to be installed by vte_install_termprop().

TERMPROP_SHELL_POSTEXEC	
An ephemeral VTE_PROPERTY_UINT termprop that signals that the shell has executed the commands entered at the prompt and these commands have returned. The termprop value is the exit code.

TERMPROP_SHELL_PRECMD	
A VTE_PROPERTY_VALUELESS termprop that signals that the shell is going to prompt.

TERMPROP_SHELL_PREEXEC	
A VTE_PROPERTY_VALUELESS termprop that signals that the shell is preparing to execute the command entered at the prompt.

TERMPROP_XTERM_TITLE	
A VTE_PROPERTY_STRING termprop that stores the xterm window title as set by OSC 0 and OSC 2. Use this with vte_terminal_get_termprop_string() instead of using vte_terminal_get_window_title().
